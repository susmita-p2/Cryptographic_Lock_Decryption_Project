## Cryptographic Lock Decryption Project

This repository contains the code as well as the observation with analysis for a cryptographic hash, that opens with a sequence of actions generated based on the string passed in creating the lock. I implemented three different search algorithms: Breadth-First Search, Depth-Limited Search, and Iterative Deepening Search to unlock the lock. These algorithms were tested on locks ranging from length 1 to 14 and recording the amount of time and space for each of them to run. With this observation, the results were compare and contrast the efficiency and effectiveness of the three algorithms. 

The detailed analysis can be found in TheLock design document. (https://github.com/susmita-p2/Cryptographic_Lock_Decryption_Project/blob/main/TheLock%20design%20document.odt)
